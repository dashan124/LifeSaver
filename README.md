OUR VIEW:
We would like to make an effort to save the water in both urban and rural areas. Rural areas face the issue of water shortage more so rain forecasting would help. Reporting of water leakage is also a good idea. And suggestion on how much water should be used for a particular task would be really helpful. Awareness about water conservation is the best solution to the problem. Mobile Application will be developed by the team.

FEATURES:
1) Water Consumption Meter: It shows user's daily consumption of water based on user activities. Also shows how much water on average should be used. 
2) Complain: Users can report the water leakage/water theft/water pollution through the app. Report would be sent to City Municipality/Gram Panchayat. 
3) Rain Detection: It shows the upcoming rain forecasts so that users can make arrangements to save the rain water.

8) Nearby Places: Shows nearby places where water is available so that water shortage can be handled.(Everyday users will be asked about water availability to work this feature out. Also there will be an option to report water shortage to properly maintain the feature. 
9) FAQ: FAQ section for the application features.

Additional features to include:
1) Pollution Notifier: It would show pollution level at the current location of the user. 
2) Sustainable Habits: Daily one update on sustainable habits with video/audio/images that would encourage people to follow those habits. 
3) User Specific Queries & Community Points: Users can ask their queries and other users can reply. If a user answers a question correctly then the user will be awarded some community points and a user with more points is more trusted.

Plan to build LifeSaver Application:
Following are implementation details of the proposed mobile application - 
1) Database - Firebase 
2) Technology - Android 
3) APIs - OpenWeatherMap, Google Maps

We would plan to build all suggested 9 features in the first build. Later the app would be improved. Also additional features would be added later.
